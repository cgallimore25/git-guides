# Setting Up a Local Git Repository from Existing GitHub Repo

This guide walks through the process of creating a local copy of an existing GitHub repository, with special focus on LaTeX project considerations.

## Initial Setup Steps

### 1. Navigate to Desired Local Directory
```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents
```

### 2. Clone the Remote Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/resume-repo.git
```

### 3. Enter the New Directory
```bash
cd resume-repo
```

### 4. Verify Repository Setup
```bash
git status    # Should show you're on branch main/master
git remote -v # Should show your GitHub repo as 'origin'
```

## Setting Up .gitignore for LaTeX

A `.gitignore` file tells Git which files to ignore when tracking changes. This is especially important for LaTeX projects, which generate many auxiliary files during compilation.

### 1. Create .gitignore File
Using Command Prompt (Windows):
```bash
echo. > .gitignore
```
Or using Git Bash/PowerShell:
```bash
touch .gitignore
```

### 2. Add LaTeX-specific Ignore Patterns
Add the following content to your `.gitignore` file:
```
# LaTeX auxiliary files
*.aux
*.log
*.out
*.toc
*.lof
*.lot
*.fls
*.fdb_latexmk
*.synctex.gz
*.bbl
*.blg
*.dvi

# Uncomment the following line if you don't want to track PDF outputs
# *.pdf

# Editor specific files
*.bak
*~
```

## Basic Workflow

1. Make changes to your LaTeX files

2. Check status of changes:
```bash
git status
```

3. Stage and commit changes:
```bash
git add main.tex
git commit -m "Updated resume with new experience"
```

4. Push changes to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Additional Tips

- **PDF Tracking**: Decide whether to track PDF files:
  - If you want collaborators to see the compiled output, remove/comment the `*.pdf` line in `.gitignore`
  - If you prefer to keep repository size small, keep PDFs ignored

- **Initial Test**: Make a small change to verify everything works:
  1. Make a minor edit to `main.tex`
  2. Commit and push
  3. Verify the change appears on GitHub

- **Credentials**: Ensure your Git credentials are configured:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Troubleshooting

If you can't push changes:
1. Verify your GitHub credentials are set up
2. Ensure you have write permissions to the repository
3. Check if you need to authenticate with GitHub (might need to set up SSH keys or use GitHub CLI)

*Note: Replace 'YourUsername' and repository names with your actual GitHub username and repository names.*
