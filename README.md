# git-guides

Git guides generated by Anthropic's Claude, a small collection of markdown cheatsheets to navigate learning command line Git.
These were created for educational purposes.

***NOTE:*** You will need to install the `Markdown Footnotes` extension by Matt Bierner (if using VS Code) to properly view the footnotes in a few of the guides.

## Brief description of their contents

1. Guides 1-3 contain information on setting up both a remote and local repository, covering a variety of cases depending on which you started with (remote from clone, base remote without local, creating remote from local)
2. Guide 4 contains a large table of common commands and associated flags
3. Guide 5 contains information on using `git` branches, including creation, switching, deletion, and synchronizing across 2 machines
4. Guide 6 describes the usage of GitHub with Overleaf, the cloud-based LaTeX implementation
5. Guide 7 describes merging and tagging releases, useful for completed branch development or marking states of the work at specific points
6. Guide 8 describes "diffing" and file comparison
7. Guide 9 includes modifications/deletions of tags introduced in Guide 7
8. Guide 10 describes resetting and reverting to previous commits
9. Guide 11 outlines file adding, moving, renaming, and removal
10. Guide 12 details some more advanced usages of `git`, such as the including, updating, or removing other `git` repos inside of your main repo
11. Guide 13, similar to 1-3, contains information on creating a personal repo from a remotely hosted template that you would like to keep updated when the template and/or its submodules are updated

If you have a suggestion for a new git guide that would cover operations currently not present, try having Claude or ChatGPT generate one for you in Markdown (`.md`), then make a pull request on the [git-guides repo](https://github.com/cgallimore25/git-guides).
